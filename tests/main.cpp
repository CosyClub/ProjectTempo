// Catch defines its own main function, we just need to include it somewhere
//
// Tests can be added by putting them in their own cpp. As long as they are
// linked in the same executable (IE: added to the CMakeLists.txt in this
// directory) CATCH will automatically run them

#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include <catch.hpp>
